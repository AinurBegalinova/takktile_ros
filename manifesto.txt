Be the best

Never lock out innovation and improvement

Provide quality product at a fair price (relative to what? to whom? benefiting whom?)
	people don't like to pay for information
	how to measure contribution?

"In an economy where more and more value is in information - is in the bits, not the atoms, where bits can be copied essentially for free - any time you have that situation, economic schemes that rely on existing models of intellectual property laws for protection are going to do less and less well. If information wants to be free, then that's true everywhere, not just in information technology."

Why license instead of developing yourself?
	don't be left behind -- ongoing 
	you won't be cut off from future improvements
